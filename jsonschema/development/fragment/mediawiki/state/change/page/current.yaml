title: development/fragment/mediawiki/state/change/page

description: >
  Fragment that represents a MediaWiki page state change in a changelog.
  This schema can be used in multiple 'enriched' versions of page state changes.
  E.g., there could be a 'page_change_with_rendered_content'
  schema that adds fields necessary for representing a change to rendered page content.
  Because we want this to be reusable, this schema does not attempt to represent
  revision content (or MCR content 'slots').  If content info is needed, you should
  add those fields to concrete schema yourself.
  See the non-fragment mediawiki/page/change schema for working example.
