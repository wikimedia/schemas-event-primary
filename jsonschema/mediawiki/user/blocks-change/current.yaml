          The prior state of the entity before this event. If a top level entity
          field is not present in this object, then its value has not changed
          since the prior event.  For user blocks changes, if prior_state is not
          present, then the User or IP did not have any existing blocks in place
          at the time this event was emitted.  This does not mean this User
          or IP never had any blocks.  It is possible that the User's block
          had automatically expired and were no longer in place when this event
          was emitted.
